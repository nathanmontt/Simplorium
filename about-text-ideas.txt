ABOUT:
--> The way that we thought was: everyone have different styles and different thinking of what they want. We, as a group, came to present to all of them that it's possible to see the simplicity on the things that, one day, can be appreciate by those "everyone".

--> As a group, we aim not just in a specific public, but on everyone who can relate to art as in an architecture spectrum. Our goal is to make everything as simple as it is suppose to be, to not make things hard to understandto the other around us
